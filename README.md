#Welcome to puzzle solvers

Simon Tatham, writer of PuTTY also wrote a collection of Portable puzzles which are implemented or reimplemented by him. All of them run natively on Unix (GTK), on Windows, and on Mac OS X. They can also be played on the web, as Java or Javascript applets.

#WHY?

This repo is dedicated to write solver algorithms for all the games. You can contribute your solution, or GUI for a solver algorithm.
